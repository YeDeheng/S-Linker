If you are trying to create an animation , look in to the ` animation ` module of matplotlib , it takes care of a lot of the details for you . 
Apparently , the " Animation " class of Matplotlib runs the animation in a separate thread . 
It simply don't use the Animation class and builds its own animation from crash . 
I think ` axis ([ xo , x1 , y0 , y1 ])` is in terms of proportion of the Figure , not the data transform . 
I used the scatter function and plotted the points , but the surface function is not working ( the window is empty ) . 
The solution I found for this involves using Normalize to make a normalised colour list based on the relevant data , mapping it to a ScalarMappable , and using that to set the face colour and c limits on each frame of the animation . 
But because all of the functionality relies on the hook , when the canvas is finally shown I presume Python's garbage collection has removed the Animation instance --- since it was never assigned to a variable --- and therefore the animation can never be started . 
Notice ` xytext = ( 0 , 0 )` means no offset , and omitting ` arrowprops ` causes ` plt.annotate ` to not draw an arrow . 
I tried adding ` / Library / TeX / Root / bin / universal-darwin ` to the Global Python Path of the Project Properties , but I still get the same errors .

But I wonder if there is a way to do the same link ( when zooming on figure 1 , I get the same zoom on figure 2 on one particular axis ) when defining 2 different Figures ( I want those graph to appear far from each other so I guess that I can't put them in the same Figure ... ) 
I removed the reference to Figure 0 and had it generate a new figure each time . 
Right now , that it the best I can do , see Figure . 
Sounds like you just want an image in the Figure , right ? 
You should perhaps try some converter that can produce DXF from EPS , PDF , SVG ... 
For example see this converter in java : 
You already have one such converter in your ` np.loadtxt ` method call . 
You can achieve this by defining a converter that converts sting representations of dates to ` datenums ` .

Axes missing when plotting in matplotlib using vispy as backend 
In theory , this code doesn't change any coordinates ; it just gets the coordinates of each label , maps it to Axes coordinates using the Text object's internally-stored transform , and then sets the position .

Axes fonts with text.usetex ' true ' does not use set font 
Also , when specifying where you want the subplot to be placed ( the third input to ` Figure.add_subplot() `) , you do not want to use ` y+1 ` because that would start at ` 1 ` and end at ` 6 ` which would go out of the available range of 0-5 . 
While it might be possible to hack ` JointGrid ` to get this to work , I suspect it will very likely be easier to just use ` kdeplot ` on one Axes , using ` twinx ` and ` twiny to place and scale the marginal plots properly . 
I want to transform those intensity values to pixel intensity values as in the following image :

Matplotlib has lots of pre-defined colormaps for you to use . 
Here are all of the predefined colormaps . 
For me the simplest way is plotting directly the masks with imshow , passing different colormaps . 
There is a list of colormaps to choose from here . 
There is also a way to define custom colormaps . 
The list of available colormaps by default is here . 
You can add your own colormaps to ` _cm.py ` in your mpl directory and then change your rc file .

Regression line and fitted curve for scatter plots in matplotlib 
but ` from matplotlib.path import Path ` throws #CODE 
The Path object does not store the points along a Bezier curve , just the minimum parameters it needs . 
Users of Path objects should not access the vertices and codes arrays 
The trick is to use Path and PathPatch . 
This allows you to get the Matplotlib Path vertices and codes in the projection coordinates which you can then convert into a new Path . 
I was playing with PathCollection ( my dyslexia is killing me switching between Path and Patch ) , and if I can get a unit circle drawn and I can apply an affine transformation to it , then I think it should work , as it doesn't seem to inherently fill the space . 
Thus the ` Spine ` objects are in question

Using Annotation Instead of Ticklabels 
What is the difference between a Text instance and string in python ? 
I believe the anti-aliasing of Text objects is up to the font engine being used . 
What you should do is save a reference to the first ` Text ` object and update its contents by calling its ` set_text() ` method . 
There is a references to the Text object returned by the original setting of suptitle in figure.texts . 
I'm having a problem with the Text object that matplotlib use to represent the ticklabels . 
I think you need to displace the ` Text ` object , using the ` set_position (( x , y ))` method . 
This includes ` Text ` objects , ` Line2D ` objects , ` collection ` objects , ` Patch ` objects ... 
Text object in matplotlib doesnt respond to zooming properly 
After drawing a matplotlib Text instance and then interactively panning , the resulting drawn text is clipped to the data window but not the surrounding bounding box . 
Something like ` Text ( 2 , 0 , u'Text ( 2 , 0 , u " Text ( 0.4 , u\ ' 0.4 \ ')")')` . 
` plt.legend ` returns a ` Legend ` object with methods that allow you to modify the appearance of the legend . 
So first we'll save the ` Legend ` object : #CODE 
In practice I seem to end up mixing them both myself in SW ; it's largely a matter of taste whether you go through the pyplot API or access the objects . pyplot is certainly very convenient although as you want to do more complex / exotic things you'll find what you can do with pyplot alone limited and you'll need to get to know at least the full API's Axes , Figure , Legend and Path objects better . 
There was a refactor of the ` Legend ` class awhile back . 
call ` Legend.get_texts() ` will get a list of Text object in the legend object : #CODE 
Some parameters could easily be read from the ` Legend ` object , others ( like ` title ` , ` fancybox `) required some ' artistics ' . 
42 from matplotlib.legend import Legend 
How do I choose the optimum width for a matplotlib Button ? 
I removed ` color=axcolor ` from the ` Button ` call ; and I added a ` plt.show() ` before the event connect , otherwise a figure window didn't appear for me ( neither through ` ipython ` , nor with ` python `) . 
button = Button ( ax=reset_axis , label= ' Reset ' , color= ' lightblue ' , hovercolor= ' 0.975 ') 
` tbar.add_button ( a Button object ); ` 
For your buttons to work , you need to keep a reference to the ` Button ` object around . 
I know how to add and work with single cursor ` self.cursor = Cursor ( self.static_canvas.Dataplot , useblit=True , color= ' red ' , linewidth=2 )` , but what I should do to create to cursors ? 
I think tillsten is right -- study how the [ ` Cursor ` class ] ( #URL ) does it . 
I've checked briefly , but I don't know how to modify the properties of an ` Arc ` instance , although I'm sure it's possible . 
You could also try passing a ` Arrow ` instance as marker , but I'm not sure whether that works . 
Currently , I don't think it possible as the ` Arrow ` class only supports `' solid ' | ' dashed ' | ' dashdot ' | ' dotted '` four different linestyles . 
The Node class has the coordinates stored as members ( x and y ) , as well as index . 
You can scale your z values to fit this range with Normalize . 
You should mention the ` Normalize ` methods here as well . 
Matplotlib provides the class ` Normalize ` for that : #CODE 
Create a new instance of ` Normalize ` for each image you want to process . 
And then you can also replicate the functionality of ` Normalize ` ( since you seem to not like it ): #CODE 
Use these to create a ` Normalize ` instance ( other normalisation classes are available , e.g. log scale ) . 
The documentation of Normalize might be a bit deceiving here : ` process_value ` is a function which is only used for preprocessing ( and static ) . 
I have several questions regarding the Normalize class in Matplotlib . 
with your own ` Normalize ` function . 
This might be why they've avoided implementing it as part of Normalize . 
matplotlib : can I create AxesSubplot objects , then add them to a Figure instance ? 
Also do you use Figure from the local matplotlib installation or not ? 
Additionally , there are functions from the pyplot interface and there are methods on the ` Figure ` class . 
I'll assume in the following that ` fig ` is an instance of a ` Figure ` : 
Both the Figure and the Axes class have a ` clear() ` method . 
I had this same problem , and it was caused by calling ` show() ` on the Figure object instead of the pyplot object . 
It got wrapped up in a subclass of Figure , which also got level-of-detail functionality and context menus . 
I have an external function which returns a Figure object , and in this situation , each Figure object is composed of exactly one Axes object . 
While a search did lead me to see that pyplot.figure() is the development team's recommended instantiation technique , it doesn't change the question : is there any way to do Axes / Figure copy construction and Figure construction via composition of copied Axes ? 
A reference to it isn't stored in the ` Figure ` object , but is stored in the ` Canvas ` object so you can destroy a window via #CODE 
Removing the ` frameon=False ` option from ` f = Figure ( figsize =( 12 , 5 ) , dpi=100 , frameon=False )` solved the issue . 
I used the Bar class to plot length of videos vs views which are the x and y values of the tuples . 
Animation will not work on inplace ( or inline ? ) on notebook . 
By artifacts , I now understand to mean you are creating a second ` Animation ` object and what you get is both of them running in parallel ( which I am not sure what I expect to happen there ) . 
by ` ax ` I mean the current ` Axis ` object , which you were getting at via ` gca ` . 
Your legend command is using the markers , not the lines as inputs by using ` plot [ 0 ]` . 
` Axes ` objects know about things like tick location and labels and the display range ( which it does by knowing about ` Axis ` object , but that is getting even more into the weeds ) . 
Use Axis method ` set_xscale ` or ` set_yscale ` . 
` ax.set_xticks() ` is a method of the ` Axes ` object , whilst ` matplotlib.ticker.FixedLocator ` is an object which is used with the ` Axis ` object ( ` Axes ` is basically the whole graph , whilst ` Axis ` is just one of the ( two ) axis ( x or y ) . 
This is not particularly well documented , but ` Polygon ` objects have a pair of methods ` get_xy ` and ` set_xy ` . 
In particular , if / when there are so many circles for the figure to become connected , the ` for polygon in polygons : ` fails with a ` TypeError : ' Polygon ' object is not iterable ` . 
Just use the ` Polygon ` or ` Rectangle ` classes : #CODE 
As you can see , the edge is center-positioned along the border of the domain of the Rectangle object , and so bleeds into this domain . 
You can do this by overplotting a Rectangle patch on the cell that you would want to highlight . 
Currently I use the ` add_patch ( Rectangle ( ... ))` , but it does not fit really well . 
Unfortunately it seems that the ' Rectangle ' object has no attribute ' set_bottom ' . 
You can acces ALL the properties of a ` Tick ` object using this approach : #CODE 
Fortunately you can update figures you've moved to where you want them pretty easily , by using the object interface specifically , and updating the Axes object without creating a new figure . 
( You can also always find this data inside the ` Axes ` object if you know where to look . ) 
By deferring the expense of drawing you can greatly improve the performance of functions that make many calls to ` Figure ` and ` Axes ` methods . 
` Figure.add_subplot() ` returns an ` Axes ` instance , and ` pyplot.subplots() ` returns an ` Axis ` object as second output parameter . 
As a side note , it is better to pass ` Axes ` objects into your function than create them ( implicitly ) internally . 
Here , what you have done is capture the ` Axes ` instance that is returned from ` add_subplot() ` . 
If I create an ` Axes ` object in ` matplotlib ` and mutate it ( i.e. by plotting some data ) and then I call a function without passing my ` Axes ` object to that function then that function can still mutate my ` Axes ` . 
Pass multiple matplotlib Axes objects from generator function and display them 
The ` transform ` in this case is a ` BboxTransformTo ` object , which : 
You can use the ` transform ` keyword : #CODE 
But when I checked the source code of draw_networkx_nodes draw_networkx , I realized that it is not a straight forward task as the draw function stores the positions ( nodes and edges ) in a numpy array , send it to the ax.scatter function of matplotlib ( sourcecode ) which is a bit hard to manipulate without messing something up . 
This simply calls the draw method of the figure periodically . 
Then I just added a signal to the custom version and overrode the draw method . 
EDIT : I'm super blind , sorry for that , you're calling the draw method , however it is a good idea to add * args and ** kwargs to any overriden methods .. try that , and perhaps call FancyBboxPatch.draw at the end of overriden method 
I'm also panning and zooming into this figure , and have been using the draw method to show the new perspectives from zooming in ( using set_xlim and set_ylim ) and from panning ( drag_pan and start_pan ) . 
I would use ` ax.autoscale ( enable=False )` before your call to ` scatter ` . 
You can perhaps loop into your ` AxesSubplot ` objects and call ` autoscale ` passing the ` axis ` parameter : #CODE 
@USER - If you'd like to rescale the axes , call ` ax.autoscale() ` every time you remove a point . 
Python : Add x-y margins automatically with autoscale ( pyplot ) 
Ahh , it's the call to ` autoscale ` that I'm missing . 
The trick is at the end , in the custom refresh method ! 
For what you're wanting to do , you'd be far better off using annotate . 
It's quite simple to do manually with ` annotate ` . 
If you're wanting to adjust vertical alignment , horizontal alignment , etc , just add those as arguments to ` annotate ` ( e.g. ` horizontalalignment= ' right '` or equivalently ` ha= ' right '`) 
It's quite simple to do manually with ` annotate ` . 
You can use the annotate command to place text annotations at any x and y values you want . 
+1 Just as a side note , annotate has " offseting the annotations a little " built-in . 
While there's nothing wrong with Ofri's answer , ` annotate ` is intended especially for this purpose : #CODE 
Just use ` annotate ` and specify axis coordinates . 
It is also possible to make an arrow with text , using the annotate method . 
The closest thing I have been able to find while searching here is the annotate command , but that appears to create a fixed label on the plot . 
` plt.annotate ( ' Something ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , -20 ) , xycoords= ' axes fraction ' , textcoords= ' offset points ' , va= ' top ')` 
@USER I'm not sure why we have to explicitly call ` draw ` . 
The ` boxplot ` function only plots quartiles ( 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 ) . 
Is there any way I can extract these values for use in my downstream code from the boxplot object ? 
I am plotting a non-normal distribution using boxplot and interested in finding out about outliers using boxplot function of matplotlib . 
You should use the ` hist ` function . 
An similar example of such plot is " hist ( x , orientation= ' horizontal ')" . 
I need to use the ` hist ` function , I have looked elsewhere on this site but I haven't found anything . 
I tried doing hist ( x / x.sum() ) but that reduce the values of the numbers in the x axis and does not change their frequency , so the y-axis is unchanged 
How can I prevent the labels of ` xticks ` from overlapping with the labels of ` yticks ` when using ` hist ` ( or other plotting commands ) in matplotlib ? 
An easy way to do this is to add ` 0j ` to the argument of the ` sqrt ` , like this , ` sqrt ( 1+0j- ( 1 / x ) **2 )` . 
You need to set the new coordinates of the datapoints in the internal ` _ofsets3d ` variable of the ` Line3DCollection ` object returned by the ` scatter ` function . 
You can use ` scatter ` for this , but that requires having numerical values for your ` key1 ` , and you won't have a legend , as you noticed . 
The ` scatter ` and ` hist ` commands really expect ` x ` and ` y ` to be 1D arrays . 
I'm wondering if it is possible to have individual alpha values for each point to be plotted using the scatter function of Matplotlib . 
The problem happens when I call the scatter function . 
Why do you say that reusing plt.figure will lead to memory issues ? 
I am using matplotlib.pyplot to create histograms . 
I corrected this using the ` set_position ` command .

You can achieve it using the ` ScalarFormatter ` : #CODE 
@USER how is hexbin useful here ? 
Hmm , doesn't look like there is anything obvious is rcParams or the matplotlibrc file . 
What you're doing is aliasing ( " renaming ") matplotlib.font_manager to FontProperties so calling fontP = FontProperties() is actually calling matplotlib.font_manager which is not callable . 
I think changing the arrowstyle will help here . 
plt.plot ( x , z ) 
` plt.tight_layout ( pad= 2.0 , h_pad= 6.5 , w_pad= 4.5 )` gives the desired result ( Fig.3 ) . 
Should work without the line ` X , Y = np.meshgrid ( X , Y )` . 
O1 = np.array ( new_OI ) 
There's no need for a vector representation of each pixel , and ` imshow ` will be much faster . 
So definitely not in an equidistant meshgrid . 
Inserted after pyplot.savefig() and the problem seems to be solved . 
` numpy.polyfit ( x , y , deg , rcond=None , full=False , w=None , cov=False )` 
Simply putting in : ` bbox =d ict ( facecolor= ' blue ' , alpha= 0.5 )` in the ax.text statement changes the color . 
ax.set_xticks ([ " 1975-01-01 " , " 1980-01-01 " , " 1985-01-01 " , " 1990-01-01 " , " 1995-01-01 " , 
Also , don't mix ` pyplot ` with guis ( unless you are explicitly using a non-interactive backend ) . 
FuncAnimation 
` x2 ' = -mu / np.sqrt ( x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2 ) * x ` , 
matplotlib.pyplot.stem ( *args , ** kwargs ) 
I've confirmed that this works for ` plot() ` as well as ` imshow() ` . 
PCA ( X ) is not the same thing as PCA ( X.T ) .T

We used the same method , but I somehow missed ` set_markeredgewidth ` . 
---> 29 import matplotlib.colorbar 
ax.plot ( r.date , r.close ) 
plt.plot() 
The ` .format ` form is the preferred way to do string formatting now as opposed to the ` % ` operator . 
` GridSpec ` works for me ( ` matplotlib ` v1.5.0 in case it matters ): #CODE 
A search of the ` matplotlib.pyplot ` API documentation does not reveal anything , so I'm afraid you'll have to live with using ` matplotlib.patches.Ellipse ` 
for why ` LinearSegmentedColormap ` shows strange color , I think this link would be helpful . 
I did so both in the Windows shell and emacs shell and the same PYTHONPATH is used . doing the rcParams both return TkAgg . 
However , the savefig() output is too zoomed out , too general . 
plt.imshow ( Xt [ 0 , :] .reshape ( 105,105 ) .T , interpolation= ' nearest ' , cmap= cm.Greys_r ) and it gives me the correct flipped output . 
See [ ` matplotlib.pyplot.contourf `] ( #URL ) for example . 
Why pyplot ( matplotlib ) is joining points randomly ?

` tick_params ` should do it . 
I have experiemented with turning interactivity on and off via ` plt.ioff() ` , but to no avail . 
don't do ` plt.xticks ... 
thx ! but in the end this worked : ` ax [ 1 ] .bar ( bins [: -1 ] , 1 . *hist / N , np.diff ( bins ) , log=True )` 
For example ` griddata ` , ` Rbf ` , ... 
It sounds like you would rather have an ` axhspan ` or ` axvspan ` . 
matplotlib : plt.isinteractive() returns 0 instead of True or False after plt.ion() is called , when the script is being run in a terminal ?

@USER Do I need to pass anything additional to ` ColorbarBase() ` ? 
In some other code , I used the OpenCV ` SaveImage ` on a single frame to provide a reference for what I would expect from ` imshow ` . 
AxesSubplot has no attribute hist2d - Matplotlib 
fig = plt.figure()

In addition , " changing plt.figure ( i )" is not correct . 
I tried it out . linecollection does not appear to work in 3D . 
You can verify it by calling ` plt.xlim() ` both before and after the ` pandas.plot() ` call . 
Did you try calling ` plt.show() ` ? 
Edit : My original answer used ` ax.scatter ` . 
The helper functions date2num() , num2date() and drange() are used to facilitate easy conversion to and from datetime and numeric ranges . 
Here's an example of how you can display multiple plots side-by-side below a larger one using Gridspec : #CODE 
I only just discovered the awesome that is ` matplotlib.mlab.psd() ` , but I am having one issue , that is : how can I change the frequency range used by the method ? 
Python Matlplotlib errorbar : some errors disappear

Documentation of legacy ` subplot() ` is [ here ] ( #URL ) and ` subplots() ` is [ here ] ( #URL ) . 
I am not completely sure if this is the kind of thing you're looking for , but ` legend() ` inside ` matplotlib.pyplot ` may be able to help you out . 
Is the PCA stuff really relevant ? 
Seaborns clustermap doesn't work with plt.tight_layout() . 
fig = plt.figure ( **figprops ) . 
From your remark that ` datetime ( 2009 , 10 , 7 , 0 ) .strftime ( ' %Hz%d%b ')` gave the right string I would've thought it worked . 
yerr = np.array ([ ])

` plt.xlabel ( u'Wavelength ( \u03bc m )')` 
You may see that how ` .ix ` was used for selecting an interval . 
I am running the tutorial for pylearn2 and I'm getting some errors when it imports ` matplotlib.pyplot ` . 
then a call to ` fig.get_size_inches() ` gives ` [ 6 , 7.475 ]` . 
I am experiencing the same problem as described in import matplotlib.pyplot hangs after updating my matplotlib version ` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ` hangs while executing ` fc-list ` . 
Using ` pcolor ` from matplotlib I am unable to do it because my pc goes easily out of memory ( more than 8G ) ..

I am trying to import Pylab using the ` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ` . 
The plt.subplots_adjust method : #CODE 
for i , j in np.where ( significant ): print i , j 
ax = fig.add_subplot ( 111 , projection= ' 3d ') 
matplotlib.pyplot does savefig() but not show() in python3 but works in 2.7 
In this case , pcolor and pcolormesh will produce the same result . 
From the documentation of ` pyplot.errorbar() ` : 
Tkinter and pyplot running out of memory 
You've already created ` ax ` with ` plt.subplots ` so don't you just need to pass ` ax=ax ` to ` merged2.fcast.plot ` instead of setting ` ax= ... 
You also should not import pylab , you should do ` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ` 
Alright I got it to work by using plt.minorticks_on() and changing the range of x to x = np.arange ( 0 , 361 , 50 , dtype = int ) .... 
You can control the ratio of the height / width with ` ax.set_aspect ( number )` . 
What about plt.title ? 
Is there a way to darken or make smoother the HSV colours so they look more like this

( ` np.all ( np.diff ( lats , axis=0 ) > 0 ))` , similar fro ` lons `) 
The problem is ' cause my np.mgrid should vary from -1 to 1 and have the self.width and self.height . 
awesome . and thanks for the np.transpose tip , too . 
And using ` set_bad ` , ` set_under ` and ` set_over ` is not a very good option as I would like to have a possibility to mark different pixels with different colours , and this limits their number to 3 . 
@USER numpy's ` memmap ` will probably not be useful for you . 
How about using ` interpolate() ` : #CODE 
cb.ax.set_major_formatter ( ticker.FuncFormatter ( myfmt )) 
special method ` __call__() ` is a good approach for such 
` plt.tight_layout() ` might do it . 
Unfortunately , I don't think you can simply do np.minimum ( array1 , array2 , array3 ) like to have above , so I think you need to nest the np.minimum calls . 
Using ` set_offsets ` doesn't seem to behave as I expect it to . 
Does the import of Axes3D do something behind the scenes to alter the import of pyplot ? 
` get_color() ` just returns the color attribute from a line .

By default ` animation.MovieWriter ` uses a ` subprocess.PIPE ` to feed the frames to the writer . 
With your ` matplotlibrc ` file , the variables ` mp.rcParams [ ' lines.linestyle ']` and ` mp.rcParams [ ' axes.grid ']` are correctly specified and this works as expected ... 
pyplot interface 
( and ` set_yticklabels ` for the y-axis ) 
I haven't checked any of the details and you should therefore not rely on it to be correct . 
You can access members and slices of the array as you would with normal numpy arrays . 
Running 1000 simulations at the same time might be a bit expensive though . 
I need to look at other formats that allow create . 
finding element of numpy array that satisfies condition 
All the results ( percentage ) are the comparison between the described condition and the reference which here is the packaged ATLAS library . 
how do you use ` slicing ` to extract something from ` x ` ? 
Mapping a numpy array pairwise 
If that is all you want to do , it should just work otherwise look at #URL since subclassing an array is not that simple . 
If you want to access an individual element using 2D notation , you can create a view and work with that . 
Regarding 3 , I don't think this would be necessary since the above trick can also be applied to an array allocated by ` shmarray ` . 
And here a list with the names of all distribution functions available in Scipy 0.12.0 ( VI ): #CODE 
I get this error whenever i try to use any functions of matplotlib such as graph etc ... 
Numpy is designed for repeated application of the exact same operation in parallel across an array . 
Each B i is a ` k ` -by- ` n ` matrix . 
I created a copy of the initial array in the hope that it would sort it out but it still doesn't work ! 
So far , all the solutions I found required converting to IPLImage . 
However , I haven't tested this very systematically , and it's likely that for smaller matrices the additional overhead would outweigh the performance benefit from a higher thread count . 
but why dimA+dimB to begin with , that just leaves you 0s at the end . 
If you select a list of actual fitness entries , ` indices ` , the corresponding points are given by ` A [ ' point '] [ indices ]` , which is a simple ` ( n , 3 )` array . 
It's also possible to generate an array of indices without using ` enumerate ` . 
If you want to keep the array allocated , and with the same size , you don't need to clear the elements . 
It'll print out all methods and properties of the object . 
Search numpy array inside numpy array 
Assigning a view to a structured array also copies the data , soyour suggestion doesnt work . 
If you know there are not many different values ( relative to the size of the input " itemArray ") , something like this could be efficient : #CODE 
When I import numpy in a script , I don't have all the functions of numpy available , only few of them ( not a lot , and not array ) ? 
It allows to have your custom system inside the home directory accessible via proot and , therefore , you can install any packages without root privileges . 
Hey , is there an optimal size for a block ? 
Numpy array , how to select indices satisfying multiple conditions ? 
I'm still learning git and this whole open source thing . 
A further problem is that a list index can't contain duplicates - I couldn't simultaneously read pixels ` [ 1 , 2 ]` and ` [ 1 , 3 ]` , since my list of pixel x-coordinates would contain ` [ 1 , 1 ]` . 
Your interpretation is , of course , quite correct : ` count ` refers to the number of elements in the ` float* ` " array " . 
This all works . 
Of course it may _not_ be acceptable , but it seemed like it was at least trying . 
I think what should happen is for R to be overwritten with an upper triangular matrix . 
@USER Is there a way to get it to return all possible solutions ? 
Thank you all for some great insight ! 
as numpy array of 0 and 1 values . 
By construction of the problem , there can not be any non-unique values lying within one another . 
Both functions are kind of equal , but are different . 
For a sparse csr matrix ( X ) and a list of indices to drop ( index_to_drop ): #CODE 
This will be relatively slow , and requires you to have twice the free memory space required to store the array . 
I need numpy for this because I don't want to loop through the array n-times for n groups , since my array sizes can be arbitrarily large . 
I wonder what the speed delta between native Numpy arrays and an ` mpfr ` array , seeing as ` mpfr ` is a relatively low-level C wrapper class . 
In this particular case , each 1D column ( ` column = myarray [ i , j , :] `) of the 3D array can be treated independently . 
Any ideas ? 
Then take element 3 and 1 from second row , etc . 
print len ( index ) 
I don't know how to label rows and columns in numpy , so I just made a dict mapping the row label to the row index and another doing the same for the columns . 
It's the same as a normal solve except I know some of the solution to begin with . 
yeah , this is the best answer anywhere where edge cases are important . 
With this , I solve the problem ( may help you ): #CODE 
Teach a man to fish and all that . 
Looks like this would be a good place to use a context manager , so you can say " with fullprint " . 
What do you mean by ' random sort ' ? 
However , it indeed does not allow you to exponentiate any matrix directly : #CODE 
The first one would probably be slow for large data , and the second one does not seem to offer any other interpolation method except splines . 
EDIT : For the record , here is example code that demonstrates the issue : #CODE 
In terms of functionality , it's not a metaclass at all , it's a function which takes a class ( along with some others stuff ) and returns a new class . 
or from source #CODE 
Didn't do any timings here , but it's possible this version has reasonable performance . 
I'll just test whether or not there's a significan space gain on my data with protocol 2 . 
Just wanted to add that the moving average function has been extracted into the [ Bottleneck ] ( #URL ) library if pandas seems too heavyweight as a dependency . 
` numpy ` can use ` malloc ` / ` realloc ` for creating an array of objects of ` sizeof ( int )` . 
If you read through the documentation of those engines you will often find statements saying that they are optimized for speed ( 30fps - 60fps ) . 
I know I have to look at each row , but I don't want to do it with loops . 
I'm hoping this can at least save someone a few hours of hopeless research for this topic . 
What does " doesn't work " mean ? 
You might look at your code that generates the ` y ` values , and see if that would benefit from the use of additional numpy or scipy functions . 
For example , give the list [ ( .3 , ' a ') , ( .4 , ' b ') , ( .3 , ' c ')] I'd like to sample ' b ' 40% of the time . 
The square bracket idea you mentioned works for my current problem . 
However , when I try to use a weighted average #CODE 
If I scale that to a 2000 X 2000 np array , here is what I get : #CODE 
Unfortunately , I'm not aware of a numpy implementation , but I did find this : #URL 
We can do this quite neatly using numpy , without having to worry about the channels at all ! 
It's not exactly the most efficient way , but it will work , and not require keeping a copy of the file in memory ( or two ) . 
I'm trying to find the fastest way to find the first non-zero value for each row of a two dimensional sorted array . 
Convert the numpy array into a list first . 
@USER do you mean that grid dictonary holds the results in memory or something else ? 
@USER : This solution is indeed designed to give the set of all the numbers found in the array . 
This way at most one line is in memory at any one time . 
It's low efficiency , I want to know are there any builtin functions that can do this in NumPy . 
The raw hardware data is 32-bit signed integer , which becomes float when I convert it to normal physics units ( m / s ) 
Calculate subset of matrix multiplication 
EDIT : as to what DSM pointed out , OP is infact using a numpy array . 
As for the second question , ` delete ` has been suggested before : #CODE 
The remaining rows of the matrices are all linear combinations ( in fact exact copies for almost all submatrices ) of these rows . 
I'm printing the contents of an array with a header . 
Edit : If you need to save memory try radix sort , which is much faster on integers than quicksort ( which I believe is what numpy uses ) . 
The data was in following order ( with sample data ) #CODE 
definitely a good solution , nevertheless I'd like to solve this without a range , but the nearest neighbour . 
For my recent project that works on the order of 20000x20000 matrix entries , I will quickly and disastrously use up all of my workstation's 8GB of RAM and more . 
Well , this might give a small speed-up just because it uses less memory . 
Try using ` all ` ( edited to return ` int `) : #CODE 
: I don't care if the statement modifies array or not . 
Rather than doing nans I put in -1 and then filtered on match = b > = 0 . 
Removing duplicate columns and rows from a NumPy 2D array 
arrays to extract arrays of the same 
as i have to test if it works or not so minimum i have to try with 10-15 different types of images . its not specific images it can be any image of people . 
So having a python loop , and having to sum all the results together , is taking 390 ms more than 200 times what it takes to solve each of the 200 systems that have to be solved . 
You could then sample pixels at the locations of the new points . 
I could use an idea about either how to fix the compilation errors or another way to convert my python objects . 
I tried every possible combination resulting with a 0 bytes file if the extension was mpg , and 5.5kb if it was avi . 
Fortran 90 DOES support arbitrary lower bounds on arrays , and borrowing from that paradigm sounds quite plausible . 
I want to perform an operation on a that increments all the values inside it that are less than 0 and leaves the rest alone . for example , if I had : #CODE 
I like how this one uses straight python slicing and doesn't require numpy 
I select the first value using ` ys [ 0 ]` . 
While waiting for the next buffer to fill , I'd like to process the most recent buffer with numpy and save the result . 
( They all do the same thing , in this case . ) 
As of PIL 1.1.6 , the " proper " way to convert between images and numpy arrays is simply #CODE 
So first you need to construct an array that represents the rows you wish to select . 
Any ideas how to improve this ? 
If this is the case , you can easily plot a known asymmetric shape and the plot will tell you everything . 
Apart from the compression part , this shouldn't be any slower than normal . 
Acquiring the Minimum array out of Multiple Arrays by order in Python

In other words ... yes you can trust it to be faster ... but don't think python is that slow that you cannot do a for loop over 3 items without waiting for ages ... 
And all that while you're getting lunch . 
If you do want to raise some sort of exception for invalid data ( not type checking ) , either let an existing exception propagate , or wrap it in your own exception type . 
casting are used in Numexpr , in contrast with NumPy , where array types 
I check mathexchange and while making the tags for the post , it didn't have any the ones that would seem relevant like scipy and numpy or even sparse . 
Any help would be appreciated . 
Say not that efficiency is a secondary priority ; say instead that I want to perform bivariate optimization : pythonicity + efficiency ( hence the post title ) . 
Does numpy have any constructs to make this easier ? 
If you view ` P ` as a rank-2 tensor then only three options exist for the product of ` P ` with itself , 1 ) either all the indexes cancel leaving you with a rank-0 tensor ( a scalar ) , 2 ) 1 set of indexes cancels and you are left with a rank-2 tensor ( a matrix ) , or 3 ) none of them cancel and you're left with a rank-4 tensor . 
At the moment I made a custom iterator class that builds a list of lists . 
This basically sees whether two circles ( with coordinates that correspond to the indices n and m ) connect . 
It would mean Gaussian quadrature using points along the line that are easily evaluated . 
I see one potential problem - beta is defined as 1-dimensional , but its value is given as 2-dimensional ( dimensions of size 1 still count as dimensions ) 
Can you provide an algorithm for computing them based on block size ? 
If ` X ` is your array , #CODE 
You could cast the array to a list : #CODE 
But if you for example self compiled from the development version an update may fix most of it . 
In VTK I am able to use the following snippet to save the render window as an image . 
In other words , the 4th row in A_sorted was the 1st row in the original array , A , etc . 
Add a ` return ` statement at the end of the method . 
However , with different input sizes , using fft's to do a convolution can be considerably faster ( Though I can't seem to come up with a good example , at the moment ... ) . 
That is a shallow copy ... 
@USER The solutions there all make use of the fact that only a 3x3 sliding window is needed , but I need something that works for all sizes of templates . 
A masked array is useful here : #CODE 
Second I would like it to be easily expandable , that I can add new functions easily . 
If i have two variables - where they either are a 1d array of values length n , or are a single value , how do i loop through them so that I get n values returned . 
I think masked arrays have been in numpy for a few years now . 
I have an array defined in this way ( extracting the third column of a dataset ): #CODE 
I wasn't aware of the option of using ` data [ list ]` to select multiple columns . 
Beware that if the type of the output array is 
Any ideas how I would do this calculation in a simpler way ? 
Those take up about 15MB of space which , considering that I get about 1000 result files in a series , is unacceptable to save . 
I'm trying to implement a logic where I'm trying to subtract each element of an array from every other element of the array and then find the minimum difference of the result . 
My final matrix should have 5416 rows with 500 000 column each . 
I am attempting to process data saved to CSV that may have missing values in an unknown number of columns ( up to around 30 ) . 
Actually the surprise is still hidden in a way , because in your examples ` a [ indices ]` is the same as ` a [ indices [ 0 ] , indicies [ 1 ]]` but ` a [ indicies , :] ` is ` a [( indicies [ 0 ] , indicies [ 1 ]) , :] ` which is not a big surprise that it is different . 
Slice numpy array wth list of wanted rows 
Here is a slightly more complex version that always returns a view into the original array ( of course provided that you don't do any advanced indexing ; this should be guaranteed by your specification of valid indices ): #CODE 
If the array is one-dimensional , this means it has no effect . 
The problem with using ` view ` , however , is that a 32-bit integer becomes viewed as 4 8-b it integers , and we only care about the value in the last 8-b its . 
So this won't solve OP's question ( unless his nD is 2 or 3 ) . 
Note : this was meant as a comment , not an answer ... just needed more room to put in the example above . 
If I wanted to change the data type of a numpy array permanently , is reassignment the best way ? 
The shifted shm-allocated array is indeed accessible from other processes . 
The second solution you propose is better from that point of view . 
It checks for nans and empty input strings . 
The ability to extract columns and rows by header name ( as in the above example ) 
With Python 2.6.5 or Python 2.7 , and Numpy 1.5.0 , I don't get any error . 
Returns a boolean array the same length as ` ar1 ` that is True 
If the objects in the array are not fixed size ( such as your MultiEvent ) the operations can become much slower . 
@USER : True the code I gave would not be all the efficient 
You print ` Length of together 2708000000 ` - where is that ` print ` statement in your code ? 
Is there a way to copy just the reference to b , so that when I change b , the change is reflected in ` a [ ' B '] [ i ]` ? 
If the matrix is not symmetric be careful about the order in dot . 
So I changed the " array " to matrix . 
config paths , cflags . 
gnibbler : That completely misses the point of the algorithm , this is a simple example , what I am doing is Gauss-Seidel iteration , which infers information about a location in a matrix by using data that has already been inferred in previous entries . 
how do i find the smallest then if this gives me the n greatest values ? 
@USER : you can wrap the insides the prange loop in ` with nogil : ` to use any Python constructs . 
For each ` Xi ` greater than ` lower_limit_X ` and less than ` upper_limit_X ` , I would like to get the number of ` Yi `' s that are greater than ` lower_limit_Y ` and less than ` upper_limit_Y ` .

I'd like to generalize this to an ellipsoid , that could ideally have any rotation . 
Is there any way to integrate the entire array at once , or do I need to integrate element-by-element ? 
I need to sum 
with ' f ' and ' F ' , or before and after the decimal point for a floating 
You can write that as a matrix : #CODE 
In fact , if you use tuples as Justin suggested and iterate directly over the rows of the array ( ` for row in data : `) , it's actually faster than my method below . 
Using the ` ctypedef ` keyword in Cython will make it add the C / C++ ` typedef ` statement with the given types in the compiled Cython-code . 
Here is how I would compute a subset of the elements of C given a list of tuples of C index values . 
In my specific problem ` A , B ` are slices out of a bigger 3-dimensional array ` Z ` , 
The solution to get all the data you need as you build the list , by using the accessor on each iteration . 
Edit : Actually you could also sort both arrays into one ( and remember which one belongs to which class ) , then go from there by checking where two of the different class are next to each other . 
How can I integrate it from a given value ` a ` to another value ` b ` so that the output is a corresponding array ? 
I want to multiply a sparse matrix A , with a matrix B which has 0 , -1 , or 1 as elements . 
If you turn a ` dict ` into an array , you'll get an object array . 
` Holy CPU cycles batman ! 
Note : Xarray and Yarray are each single-column vectors with data at each index that links the two arrays as sets of x , y coordinates . 
Yeah , my rule-of-thumb is ** numpy ** for anything that can handle small amounts of latency but has the potential to be very large , ** lists ** for smaller data sets where latency critical , and of course ** real benchmarking ** FTW :) 
You need to know what kind of information is stored in each field for the ` struct ` module to make sense of each field . 
Once you have this array , you can get your sums for each vertex as #CODE 
Where are ` plot ` and ` show ` coming from ? 
But it might be easier ( and more understandable when you look at the code in the future ) to just drop into Cython to get this done . 
I can't comment on the Perl code , I simply don't know it at all . 
I updated the answer with a full example . 
There you will find C code which provides the same functionality as ` fmincon ` . 
so for instance , for an array the code looked like #CODE 
I've been trying to find a solution for hours . 
Note that as implemented here , the first method gives incorrect results according to my test . 
This is my test code : #CODE 
This will short-circuit if you just want to determine if any match exists . 
It also helps to know that a resource like Wolfram Alpha is available to you at all times . 
What I meant was if we had three arrays ` X =[ 0 1 2 ] , Y =[ 0 1 1 ] , and Z =[ 0 2 2 ]` there would be six values in the range of greater than or equal 1 and and less than or equal to 2 . 
You should really split this into two separate questions since each part is distinct . 
This doesn't answer your problem exactly , but I think especially with the sum issue that you should see significant speedups with these changes . 
Basically you're iterating through each item in ` Xa ` and omitting the ones that don't fall with the range . 
This code has been written following the tips ( and copy / pasting ): #URL 
I would look at this question : #URL 
As @USER -Anderson asked , why not avoid making an array ? 
to create such an array . 
In short , I find class C to provide an implementation that is over 60x faster than the method in the original post . 
I suggest allocating an array of the correct size up-front , then populating it with data in each iteration . 
edited my solution to include what I would do . let me know if this work , as i cannot fully test because i dont have test data . 
The problem is if i don't want 0:10 , but an arbitrary set of indices . 
and it occurs at the line : ` del innerAry [ j ]` 
Do you have any references to back up that ` NaN handling is much slower than " normal " float at the CPU level ` ? 
What do you mean by the line ? 
For example if we stick with a linear search we can at least start at the appropriate end ( search backwards to find last value matching a condition ) . 
Yes , but you don't get a numpy array out , do you ? 
This seems like a simple question , but I haven't been able to find a good answer .

I'm liking fortran more at the moment because by the time you add all the required type annotations in cython I think it ends up looking less clear than the fortran . 
( There are also chances that Python stores the number on the heap and all you get is a pointer to it , approximately doubling the footprint , without even taking in account metadata but that's slippery grounds , I'm always wrong when I talk about Python internals , so let's not dig it too much . ) 
Do you have any clue ?

In another question , other users offered some help if I could supply the array I was having trouble with . 
The other thing is changing the size of the ticklabels in the colorbar which I haven't figured out . 
Unfortunately , these lines are fast already , but I will take any speedup to offset the IO issues I have using GDAL . 
First you need to write a function that when given an array of values , with the middle one being the element currently examined , will return some computation of those values . 
Thanks in advance for any help . 
so what you want is some sort of recursive assignment -- but i don't believe there is any guarantee that this will settle down into a constant value . sure it does in your case , but not in general -- for example : ` a [: ] = 2*a [: ]` would loop forever . 
Just initialize the array of ` float* ` to point to each of the rows in the 2-D array .

EDIT 2 : This raises another question - What is ` env ` and why does ` make ` add it ? 
However it doesn't give you negative overflows , probably because ` uint32 ` fits inside the positive values of the ` int64 ` . 
Consider for example the array : #CODE 
One difference could be the result of python having to take extra steps to resolve the float64 types .

Bah : " operates on two n-dimensional arrays " should be " operates on an n-dimensional array " above . 
Instead , they expect the user to either pass an array of shape ` ( r , c )` exactly , or for the user to pass a 1-D array that broadcasts up to shape ` ( r , c )` . 
Though , it isn't so straight forward because I don't necessarily know how many duplicates of each lon or lat there are which determines the shape of the array .

A variable in Python is just a label for an object ; giving the object a new label doesn't change the object itself at all . 
But this is actually where the doc belongs . 
So given the sorted version , you can reconstruct the original by " putting items back where they came from " : #CODE 
Note that this all assumes that your values are normally distributed .

Appending data to an existing array is a natural thing to want to do for anyone with python experience . 
Note that you get a sorte copy of the array . 
I'm not sure that this is the way that you should do things as I'd expect numpy to have a much more efficient method of going about it , but do you just mean something like this ?

For example , one simple method to generate at most rank ` k ` ( when ` m ` is ` k+1 `) is to get a random valid B 0 , keep rotating all rows of this matrix up to get B 1 to B m-2 , set first row of B m-1 to all 1 , and the remaining rows to all 0 . 
Glad you saw around it !

This ensures proper display and syntax highlighting - right now someone who would usually fix your formatting is likely to not do it because he'd have to remove all the HTML linebreaks on his own . 
I believe you've reduced the problem to a one of finding roots . 
In order to make sure it is still multiprocessor safe , I believe you will have to use the ` acquire ` and ` release ` methods that exist on the ` Array ` object , ` a ` , and its built in lock to make sure its all safely accessed ( though I'm not an expert on the multiprocessor module ) . 
So , given your matrix M , your problem asks to maximize the PB function #CODE 
I would like to find all elements within a specific range . 
I cannot seem to find how to do that . 
Any thoughts ? 
If you want the PRNGs to be independent , do not seed them with anything . 
In the end I'll probably take n randomly selected samples . 
This is a mystery to me , though I would guess that there must be more overhead associated with accessing an array element than with appending to a list . 
If it's not reasonable , you can always decompose the matrix multiplication yourself . 
If the vectors do not have equal dimension , or if you want to avoid numpy , then perhaps , #CODE 
In particular , you can't index a 2D matrix with a single integer , because -- well -- it's two dimensional and you need to specify two integers , hence the need for the extra 0 index in the second example .

@USER he basically considers x as my array and defines a function that gives the range of each row .. works fine . 
I was just curious to find a * best practice * in this instance I suppose . 
I'm guessing there's an easy way to do this without iterating through the full array . 
I don't know how efficient ` Image ` is at storing images , but a list of bytes uses four bytes of space for each element in the list , so you'll burn more than 8GB of ( virtual ) memory ... and a lot of patience . 
They are all floats 
I want to efficiently iterate through the two columns , a [: , 0 ] and a [: , 1 ] and remove any pairs that meet a certain condition , in this case if they are NaN . 
I turned ` color_array ` into a two-dimensional array , since this seems more appropriate . 
An important caveat is that the array must be * contiguous * in memory -- otherwise the view fails . 
You might want to also make sure that you use a method of generating your random numbers that causes them to fall into the range of 16 bit ints . 
I have a 100x200 2D array expressed as a numpy array consisting of black ( 0 ) and white ( 255 ) cells . 
If you know the shape of the array ( to find discover the edges ) you can use simple math ... annoying , time consuming ( to write and process ) , but pretty straight forward . 
And yet another way , possibly faster ( thanks for all the comments , guys ! ): #CODE 
Now , you can construct another matrix , B , that has 1s at certain locations to pick the elements from the set E . 
But overhead of all the object creation it's true , plus the time of Numpy array creation . 
I was trying to calculate the curvature of a surface given by array of points ( x , y , z ) . 
You also don't have any speed improvement , when you try to do a function return in C instead of doing that in python , also array access is neglectable compared to the cost of the function call .

Check if values in a set are in a numpy array in python 
Would you know of a way to ** average ** the duplicates instead of sum them ? 
I think that I phrased the question badly ; what I meant is I want a list when I input a list and I want a numpy array when I input a numpy array . 
I have a list of numbers and I need to split into to corresponding arrays of different sizes , but that make up all the combinations of the array splitting up . 
Yes , it is true that before you ask any question on stackoverflow , you should perform a minimum of research which includes looking for existing answers on stackoverflow . 
This is probably the thing that is most important for numpy to know ... although there may be other subtle differences ( if numpy is doing some dirty hacking to get at information stored in a common block for instance ) . 
You might want to add this link to the response : #URL 
A list takes up significantly more memory than a comparably sized numpy array ( factor of ~2 ) -- So why are you going back to using lists ? 
From my understanding , when you use python standard operators , these are fairly similar to using the ones from " import operator . 
This gives you 4000 samples of your function , sampled at 33.33 Hz , representing 120 seconds of data . 
Before , what you were doing was having SWIG convert the C++ ` std :: vector ` objects into Python tuples , and then passing those tuples back down to ` numpy ` - where they were converted again . 
Currently I am generating a list of 7 numbers with random values from [ 0-1 ) then multiplying by [ X1 .. X7 ] 
Introducing the transposing of the matrix everything is working correctly . 
So I did everything , but I feel the slicing method I used ( and the initialisation of ` b `) is not pythonic at all : #CODE

Depending on the rig you have at the moment , optimizing your SciPy 
Examples would be the git commit id of the current version , and the input parameters used to generate the data so that later I can look at the data and know exactly how I created it . 
There are other ways to do this ( you may want to avoid storing a reference to a specific numpy array in each ` point ` , for example ) , but I hope it's a useful example . 
I downloaded a new version of ` pip ` and installed locally in my home directory but the system wide old one is still used when I type ` pip ` at the prompt . 
I need to iterate over the matrix summing all elements in rows 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 only 
If you compare point i to point i+1 and remove all for which the distance is less than your threshold , then you will miss the cumulative effect of many small steps in the same direction . 
In my output array I only want to include rows for position values which appear in all 3 input arrays . 
Perhaps you should change the title of this question to more accurately reflect your specific problem . 
Perhaps there is a good choice for this special case .

Addressing ranges in a Scipy sparse matrix 
Still , I would like something much more computationally efficient , like relying on builtin numpy functions , but I cannot find relevant functions , can someone help me ? 
You can run the test suite to see if the build works . 
The bit where you index into the original CSR matrix is surely expensive . 
I don't believe there's a way to do what you're asking ( it would require unaligned access , which is highly inefficient on some architectures ) . 
This should give a large speedup compared with iterating over each row in the array ... 
Not sure what addition you're talking about nor what random replacements you mean .

I do not want to store the array objects , I want to store the lists of numbers in a record list . 
I have tried two different methods but both of them are slow . 
Where can I find information regarding the ` L ` option and other options ? 
The essential problem was that when the array is 1d you call it array [ i ] when it is 2d you call it array [ i ] [ j ] , without two separate cases I don't know how to handle this . 
You can iterate through your input file ( in chunks if possible ) and convert the incoming data and insert them as rows into a memory-mapped numpy array . 
This all works great when I run the Python ( command line ) tool that comes with Python . 
The standard linear algebra methods you seem to be thinking of cannot ( to the best of my knowledge ) be used to solve this sort of constrained integer problem . 
You will probably find answers to all your questions regarding NumPy and parallel programming on the official wiki .

@USER : the reference count might be needed ( though I'm not entirely sure in this case ) because no other thread must deallocate the array . 
I looked around but couldn't find anything syntax wise regarding this specific scenario . 
While this involves copying , do you do this often enough for the cost of the copy to be a problem ? 
I think you can see where this is going . 
Here is a sample function ( you need to have the pyopencv module installed ): #CODE 
I have learned now that numpy does internally create a temporary array for the output and in the end copies this array , that is why it fails for the values that are zero in the original array . 
If your list is sorted , you can achieve very quick search of index with the ' bisect ' package . 
How to save a boolean matrix ? 
I have need to slice an array where I would like zero to be assumed for every dimension except the first . 
will compile machine code that will execute fast and with minimal memory overhead , taking care of memory locality stuff ( and thus cache optimization ) if the same array occurs several times in your expression , 
First , note that for most everyday uses , you probably won't require an array ( which is a special datatype in Numpy ) . 
Not sure if it helps but if you add another array of a different shape , it converts back to the types you want : #CODE

numpy array plot matrix matplotlib 
After the records are loaded , I can access them in the normal NumPy fashion . 
Eventually , I'm looking for a way of creating graphs similar to the one below using naive Python ( with any " standard " library such as numpy , matplotlib etc , but without using R or other external tools ) . 
On a general note however , in numpy it is better to always use base class arrays unless you are doing a lot of matrix multiplications , etc . 
Exact , in optimization context , and as far as Powell Badly Scaled function is used for test , I impose some box constraints . 
At the moment I have the lines in a list of lists then looping through and testing for identity with the previous value at index 0 in the list but this is very clumsy . 
Calculating the exact dimensions of this array : I tried len ( x [ 0 ]) and len ( x ) to get the both dimensional coordinates , but this way seems a bit hackish . 
If you know the size , you might want to consider pre-allocating the array and parsing it yourself .

Try converting your the pandas data series to lists or numpy array before plotting . 
If I de-homogenize only the last column I can find the center of where the ellipse was projected , but I would like to see some shape information as well .

Load the data sets individually , and then plot each one individually . 
Have you looked at mplot3d on matplotlib ? 
The columns are floats , I'm not using the index of integers . 
Incidentally ( for someone reading this in the future as you know yours ) if you need to find your current Python version you can simply type ` python -V ` in the command line and it'll return the details , for example mine returns :

To specify that you want the first interval filled with " pure " black , set ` vmin=mean ( lvls [: 1 ])` in your example . 
Your Data looks pretty good without any filtering , your " outlieres " all have a very big error and won't affect the fit much . 
This is a terribly unclear answer , at least some comment in the code or explanation of why this helps floating point error would be nice . 
I produce a histogram where I put the weights in the parameter #CODE 
Besides , I see that you use ` numpy ` in your code , so you can save and load file by ` numpy ` with a more compact codes like this without using the ` csv ` module . 
Usually these sorts of simple array reshaping operations can be done in a couple of lines with Numpy , so I feel like I'm missing something . 
I don't see any way I could do that . 
Look at the docs : #CODE 
To fix that we turn the frame off on ` ax1 ` ( so we can see ` ax2 `) .

But how can I make plt do all this stuff ? 
From your piece of code it seems to me that ` clust_data ` is already a list of lists with the correct shape and that ` cellText ` after being filled is going to be the same of ` clust_data ` . 
Anaconda doesn't by default load pylab into IPython so you can choose the backend after launching IPython . 
Most likely I'll have graphs with longer labels and if I put them near lines , it'll look messy . 
The lines are random within ranges that cause clustering of lines ; a behavior I wanted to verify . 
have those lists all the same length aka would it be directly compatible witha 2d numpy array ? 
Any assistance will be appreciated .

You need some criteria to select out the " best " in your context . 
What do you mean when you say ` the first histogram will be the first column as the x values plotted against the second column as the y-values ` . 
Unfortunately I don't have any experience doing this so won't be able to help .

Also , I do not want user intermediation at all ! 
Rather than put together an example from scratch , there's an excellent example of this written by Paul Ivanov in the matplotlib examples ( It's only in the current git tip , as it was only committed a few months ago . It's not on the webpage yet . ) . 
what to do next ? 
I think you'll find you get better help if you describe * what * you're trying to do , rather than * how * you want to do it .

You could cast the array to a list : #CODE 
Add as many symlinks to the directory as you wish , it gives you fine-grained control over which packages you want to make accessible . 
In the end , I found out that the problem was simply that matplotlib could not find any backend for plotting . 
Please change your title to describe your _actual_ issue . 
If you did not create one when you installed matplotlib , you can get this template from the matplotlib source , or from the matplotlib website .

any idea ? 
@USER : I suppose the specific way I have it set up would work better if you had , say , a 1000x1000 matrix , as it lets numpy pick how the tics should be spaced . 
As you can see it only covers half of the matrix . 
You iterate the items in ` glass ` , but then compare to the whole list instead of to the current ` item `

What do you mean the " label " ? 
To do this we ll use the standard y=mx+b line equation where m is the line s slope and b is the line s y-intercept . 
If you check the Matplotlib example for the function you are using , you will notice they use a similar methodology : build empty matrix and fill it with strings built with the interpolation method .

But there are still white edges around ( I have added a screenshot to my original question ) 
How could I use ` matplotlib ` to represent such a matrix as a grid of red and black squares ? 
The thick grey line in the middle of the violin is the bootstrapped 99% confidence interval of the mean , which is the white horizontal line , both from pointplot . 
@USER I up voted you but add ` import numpy as np ` 
So , when you reduce to 2 dimensions , the power is the sum of the first 2 eigen values . 
Indexing starts with ` 0 ` in Python ( and most any other programming language I know ) . 
I have a matrix file of Hurricane data and it plots with the command : #CODE 
If they enter 30 , they will look at a 30-minute time window , if they type 5 , matplotlib picks this up , data gets trimmed , and only 5 minutes worth of data gets shown . 
In the meanwhile does any one has a better suggestion ? 
I want it at y= 10.5 , specifically . 
I then plot each of these values , but to get a more sensible result , I need to take the mean of all of these files for each cell , and plot that with the standard deviation obtained as error bars . 
I'm using data of the form : ` [ num1 , num2 ,..., numk ]` ( an array of integers ) . 
For the time steps where convergence is reached Id like to have the x-axis green and for non-convergence starting from light red for not so bad to red for bad . 
For instance you can add #CODE 
I don't want to get a newer one just incase any of the practice problems / lecture problems are incompatible with a newer version of IDLE . 
All of these frames are loaded at the start of the application . 
if you suspect one specific builtin , try checking it's type ( ` type ( dict )`) , or look at the properties / functions it has ( ` dir ( dict )`) . 
In some work I have done we used a simple approximation of the derivative , when this changes sign you have a peak ( in 1D data ) , one can then add some parameters to remove peaks due to noise . 
Here's a working code sample that shows you how to get it working . 
How can I change this behavior and use Arial fonts for all of my plots ? 
How to divide ytics to a certain number in matplotlib ? 
Matplotlib cannot find facefile , is using old Python interpreter location 
do you get any message when trying plotting it ? 
I have mac os x 10.5.8 and was wondering if anyone could recommend where I could find the proper package . 
Well , this isn't a wxPython answer but I've used Chaco for this sort of thing and it's pretty straight forward . 
The point IS at its position namely ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) . 
All is fine again . 
The next plot to show has the same clusters and colors but a different location . 
@USER The first approach would help only if the internal representation was the problem , but it doesn't solve the underlying size issue . 
After hours analyzing the source code of basemap's ` tissot ` function , learning some properties of ellipses and lot's of debugging , I came with a solution to my problem . 
You'd need to refactor the code to break your worker method up into smaller pieces that multiple processes can work on at the same time , and then pull it back together once all the pieces are ready . 
are you just trying to open a separate window or display that window inside of your main window ? 
The one catch : if you embed a PDF inside a textbox , Word will rasterize this when you save it to a PDF . 
How can I address a specific line ( by name , by number , by reference ) throughout the program and delete that line ? 
And also I need to do that for all variables simultaneously . 
` newtitle = " %s\n$%s$ " % ( ' text\ below\ the\ main\ title ' , newtitle )` 
Have you had a look at the ` webagg ` matplotlib backend ?

If you want separate figures , as the title of your question suggests the ` subplots=True ` argument might get the job done . 
I suggest removing all the domain specific stuff . 
Just change ` shape ` to ` ( 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 )` and see . 
Any help would be appreciated . 
However , ( at least what I have seen is that ) sometimes after the plot has been displayed , it goes into a " Not Responding " mode and you just have to kill the process anyways . 
It consists in a floating-point parameter P , with dimension NxM , and each pixel is geolocated by the fields latitude and longitude ( each of size NxM ) . 
In order to change the order of the bars , you should change the order in the index . 
This does not work when I replace the random plot data with an actual color PNG image . 
For example , say you had data between 0 and 1 but didn't like the colors used at the extremes of the colormap for 0 and 1 . 
After searching through multiple posts , I basically want to use a generic colormap ( rainbow ) and multiply my third array by the colormap in order to display different colors for each of the xy points . 
Hi , Thanks Tobold , I will check the source code you mention . 
This next block is what does what you want with the ` for ` loop . 
Say that I have 6 variables that I want to sort into these 3 groups and plot like a venn diagram . 
ValueError : setting an array element with a sequence . 
My need is that I want to plot these nominal values of both actual and predicted ones on the same plot so that It will be easy to compare how good was the prediction as compared to actual values . 
So , open up your favorite Terminal emulator and enter #CODE 
Also , the lists need to be equal length . 
Because matplotlib will convert things to numpy arrays regardless , there are more efficient ways to do it . 
And here is where I grab the data and I try to update the limits of the plot #CODE 
Any help is appreciated . 
Which is the why , conveniently , ` colors ` keyword exists . 
How can I find the code to support multiple plotting scales and X-axis on seperate panels using sizer routines ? 
I'm trying to build Matplotlib from source with Tkinter . 
This means that you can install matplotlib locally in your ` virtualenv ` and it will find all of its backend dependencies in the system-wide ` site-packages ` . 
I am trying to create a simple GUI using tkinter which will just open a window displaying the plot . 
Web convinces me using this is no good idea after all : For example #URL " Avoid 3-D charts at all costs . 
Using pure Python , you can extract columns ` 1 ` , ` 5 ` and ` 7 ` by using the following nested list comprehension : #CODE 
Is there any way of getting some input from a user in matplotlib ? 
` theta ` is in radians instead of degrees . 
' plot ' shows me a line interconnecting all data points , but not the data points themselves ( unless there's a way I don't know of ) . 
I could divide the ` peak_top ` by 2 to find the half height and then try and find y-values corresponding to the half height , but then I would run into trouble if there are no x-values exactly matching the half height . 
why can't it find the file ? 
However , the resulting image always has the same resolution , around ( 250x250 ) . 
Installing those packages from the source can be a pain , especially on Windows and OS X . 
Sort arrays by two criteria 
However , I am kinda confused , any help would be appreciated . 
Unfortunately if you search this array for all subnodes given some index you only get some of the subnodes contained by the original triangle because most nodes belong to several triangles and they are only added to one of these . 
If I set shrink 1.0 and fraction to anything , it shrinks the graph , not affecting the colorbar size at all , until changing fraction causes it to be exactly what I already have , at which point changing them stops doing anything . 
It doesn't add anything else . 
Now I just wish they'd add some kind of drop down menu to matplotlib ... 
Thanks for any help 
The source data's list is called xyz . 
I have been looking around and maybe it could be a version-of-Pyhton problem . 
( I want to reduce the size of the outlier ) #CODE 
This should work for any number of columns and length of data . 
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated , this has been doing my head in . 
where axes_square is simply : #CODE 
I can put together a more detailed answer based on that package if desired . 
It's fairly easy to speed it up by making an approximation -- just take the 2D histogram and blur it with a guassian filter of the right radius and covariance . 
I've tried the solutions posted by Marek and qarma attempting to obtain the coordinates of the bins rather than the index of them , like so : #CODE 
What do you mean by make sure the ' backend setting for pylab is not set to inline ? 
sets the initial x , v of every particle in an array 
Post more information on structure of your array . 
Here is a sample code if anyone wants to play with it . 
Are all these settings really necessary to achieve the result I'm looking for , or is there perhaps a more compact way to accomplish my goal : #CODE 
I want to select ( in the SQL sense ) just columns ` b0 ` through ` b9 ` from the array , giving the structure #CODE 
I can't find any method to tell mpl to plot all of the data , it seems that there are only methods for drawing every n'th element or similar ( and passing 1 does not help ) .
